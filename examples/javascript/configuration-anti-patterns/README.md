# Configuration Anti-Patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript

This example demonstrates common configuration anti-patterns that make code difficult to test and maintain, along with their solutions.

## Problems

### 1. Hard-coded Configuration Values

- Configuration values are written directly in code
- No way to change values without modifying code
- Makes testing different configurations difficult
- Can lead to security issues (e.g., exposed API keys)
- Makes deployment to different environments difficult

### 2. Environment-specific Configuration

- Configuration is tightly coupled to environment
- Different environments require different code
- Makes testing in different environments difficult
- Can lead to environment-specific bugs
- Makes deployment more complex

### 3. Configuration Scattered Across Codebase

- Configuration values are spread throughout the code
- No single source of truth for configuration
- Makes it difficult to track configuration changes
- Can lead to inconsistent configuration
- Makes testing more complex

### 4. No Configuration Validation

- Configuration values are not validated
- Invalid configuration can cause runtime errors
- Makes it difficult to catch configuration errors early
- Can lead to hard-to-debug issues
- Makes testing error cases difficult

### 5. Runtime Configuration Changes

- Configuration can be modified at runtime
- No clear boundaries for configuration changes
- Makes testing state changes difficult
- Can lead to race conditions
- Makes behavior unpredictable

### 6. Configuration Dependencies

- Components depend on specific configuration values
- Changes to configuration affect multiple components
- Makes testing components in isolation difficult
- Can lead to tight coupling
- Makes refactoring more complex

## Solutions

### 1. Centralized Configuration

- Configuration is managed in one place
- Clear structure for configuration values
- Makes testing different configurations easier
- Improves security by isolating sensitive values
- Makes deployment simpler

### 2. Environment-agnostic Configuration

- Configuration is independent of environment
- Environment-specific values are injected
- Makes testing in different environments easier
- Reduces environment-specific bugs
- Simplifies deployment

### 3. Configuration Validation

- Configuration values are validated at startup
- Invalid configuration causes clear errors
- Makes it easier to catch configuration errors
- Improves debugging experience
- Makes testing error cases easier

### 4. Immutable Configuration

- Configuration cannot be modified after creation
- Clear boundaries for configuration changes
- Makes testing state changes easier
- Prevents race conditions
- Makes behavior more predictable

### 5. Configuration Injection

- Configuration is injected into components
- Components don't depend on specific values
- Makes testing components in isolation easier
- Reduces coupling
- Makes refactoring simpler

### 6. Clear Configuration Boundaries

- Each component has its own configuration
- Configuration changes are localized
- Makes testing easier
- Improves maintainability
- Makes code more modular

## Testing Strategies

1. **Test Configuration Validation**

   - Verify valid configuration
   - Test invalid configuration
   - Check error messages
   - Test edge cases
   - Test type validation

2. **Test Configuration Immutability**

   - Verify configuration cannot be modified
   - Test configuration updates
   - Check error handling
   - Test edge cases
   - Test type safety

3. **Test Configuration Injection**

   - Verify components receive configuration
   - Test different configurations
   - Check error handling
   - Test edge cases
   - Test dependency injection

4. **Test Configuration Boundaries**
   - Verify component isolation
   - Test configuration changes
   - Check error handling
   - Test edge cases
   - Test component interaction

## Key Lessons

1. **Design for Testing**

   - Centralize configuration
   - Make configuration immutable
   - Use dependency injection
   - Define clear boundaries
   - Validate configuration

2. **Clear Boundaries**

   - Isolate configuration
   - Define validation rules
   - Use type checking
   - Make testing easier
   - Make code more maintainable

3. **Proper Error Handling**

   - Validate configuration
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Handle edge cases
   - Make error handling explicit
   - Make testing easier

4. **Maintainable Code**
   - Write clear, documented code
   - Use proper abstractions
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Make testing easier
   - Make code more maintainable

## Running the Tests

```bash
npm test
```

This will run the test suite and show you how to properly test code with configuration management.
