# State Management Anti-Patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript

This example demonstrates common state management anti-patterns that make code difficult to test and maintain, along with their solutions.

## Problems

### 1. Global Mutable State

- State is stored in global variables
- State can be modified from anywhere
- No clear boundaries for state changes
- Makes testing difficult due to shared state
- Can lead to race conditions and bugs

### 2. Shared State Between Components

- Multiple components access the same state
- State changes affect multiple components
- No clear ownership of state
- Makes testing difficult due to dependencies
- Can lead to unexpected behavior

### 3. Implicit State Dependencies

- State dependencies are not clearly documented
- Components depend on state they don't own
- State changes have hidden effects
- Makes testing difficult due to hidden dependencies
- Can lead to maintenance issues

### 4. State Mutation Without Boundaries

- State can be modified at any time
- No clear rules for state changes
- State changes are not atomic
- Makes testing difficult due to unpredictability
- Can lead to inconsistent state

### 5. Inconsistent State Updates

- Different components update state differently
- No clear pattern for state updates
- State can become inconsistent
- Makes testing difficult due to complexity
- Can lead to bugs

### 6. Race Conditions

- Multiple operations modify state simultaneously
- No synchronization of state changes
- State can become corrupted
- Makes testing difficult due to timing issues
- Can lead to hard-to-reproduce bugs

## Solutions

### 1. Encapsulated State

- State is encapsulated in classes
- State can only be modified through defined methods
- Clear boundaries for state changes
- Makes testing easier
- Prevents unexpected state changes

### 2. Immutable State Updates

- State is immutable
- Updates create new state instances
- State changes are explicit
- Makes testing easier
- Prevents state corruption

### 3. Clear State Boundaries

- Each component owns its state
- State changes are localized
- Clear rules for state updates
- Makes testing easier
- Prevents state leaks

### 4. Predictable State Changes

- State changes follow clear patterns
- State updates are atomic
- State changes are documented
- Makes testing easier
- Prevents inconsistent state

### 5. State Isolation

- Components have isolated state
- State changes don't affect other components
- Clear interfaces for state access
- Makes testing easier
- Prevents unexpected side effects

### 6. Atomic State Updates

- State updates are atomic
- No partial state changes
- State changes are synchronized
- Makes testing easier
- Prevents race conditions

## Testing Strategies

1. **Test State Updates**

   - Verify state changes
   - Check state boundaries
   - Test atomic operations
   - Test error cases
   - Test edge cases

2. **Test State Isolation**

   - Verify component boundaries
   - Check state encapsulation
   - Test state access
   - Test error cases
   - Test edge cases

3. **Test Atomic Operations**

   - Verify atomic updates
   - Check synchronization
   - Test race conditions
   - Test error cases
   - Test edge cases

4. **Test Error States**
   - Verify error handling
   - Check error boundaries
   - Test error recovery
   - Test error cases
   - Test edge cases

## Key Lessons

1. **Design for Testing**

   - Encapsulate state
   - Use immutable updates
   - Define clear boundaries
   - Make state changes predictable
   - Isolate state

2. **Clear Boundaries**

   - Define state ownership
   - Document state changes
   - Use clear interfaces
   - Make testing easier
   - Make code more maintainable

3. **Proper Error Handling**

   - Handle errors properly
   - Define error boundaries
   - Test error cases
   - Make error handling explicit
   - Make testing easier

4. **Maintainable Code**
   - Write clear, documented code
   - Use proper abstractions
   - Follow SOLID principles
   - Make testing easier
   - Make code more maintainable

## Running the Tests

```bash
npm test
```

This will run the test suite and show you how to properly test code with state management.
